# Novels

## App Description
The app is a review aggregator for books using users and reviewers scores.
Users can register and login to see their favorite books that they save. If a user is not logged in, they cannot access their profile of books. A user can browse through genres and books and then add them to their favorites. When a user clicks on a book title, it will direct them to a full page of the book. At the full page display, a user can add a book, and leave a comment about the book.
